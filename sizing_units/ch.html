        <h1>Using a <code>ch</code> unit to size text</h1>
        <p>The <code>ch</code> unit allows you to control the size of text based on its actual contextual sizeâ€”the width
            of a <code>0</code> character.
            This means that if you set the max width of some text as <code>70ch</code>: regardless of the size of that
            text, you can always be sure that it will be at most, 70 characters wide. </p>
        <p>Go ahead and change the font sizes and max widths of these elements in the CSS editor to see it working.</p>
