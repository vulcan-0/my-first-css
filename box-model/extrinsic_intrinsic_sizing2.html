                            <p>You can edit this text to see how it changes the layout of our box, depending on
                                intrinsic and extrinsic sizing.</p>
                            <p>Toggle intrinsic sizing on and off to see how extrinsic sizing gives you more control
                                with extrinsic sizing and intrinsic sizing gives the content more control. To see the
                                effects add a few sentences of text to the card. When this element has extrinsic sizing,
                                there's a limit to how much content you can add before it overflows, but that doesn't
                                happen when intrinsic sizing is toggled on.</p>
                            <p>By default, this element has a set width and height of 400px each. These dimensions give
                                strict bounds to everything inside the element, which are honored unless the content is
                                too large for the box. You can see this in action by changing the caption under the
                                flower picture to something that exceeds the height of the box.</p>
                            <p>Key term: Overflow happens when content is too big for the box it's in. You can manage
                                how an element handles overflow content using the overflow property.</p>
                            <p>Switching to intrinsic sizing lets the browser make decisions for you based on the box's
                                content size. This makes overflow much less likely because the box resizes with its
                                content.</p>
                            <p>It's important to remember that intrinsic sizing is the browser's default behavior, and
                                it usually provides much more flexibility than extrinsic sizing.</p>
